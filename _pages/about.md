Hello! I am a postdoctoral scholar at UC Berkeley and a visiting scholar at UC San Diego. I completed my Ph.D. in Physics at Caltech in August 2024. I am a theoretical particle physicist interested in a diverse set of topics in high-energy theory, phenomenology, astrophysics, and cosmology. Much of my research focuses on understanding how ideas in beyond-the-Standard-Model (BSM) physics can be tested through experiments and observations.
