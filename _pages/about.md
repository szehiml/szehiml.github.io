I am a theoretical particle physicist interested in a diverse set of topics in high-energy theory, phenomenology, astrophysics, and cosmology. Much of my research focuses on understanding how ideas in beyond-the-Standard-Model (BSM) physics can be tested through experiments and observations. I am currently a postdoctoral scholar at UC Berkeley and a visiting scholar at UC San Diego, supported by the [Network for Neutrinos, Nuclear Astrophysics, and Symmetries (N3AS)](https://n3as.berkeley.edu/).

I defended my Ph.D. thesis at Caltech in August 2024 and received my Ph.D. in Physics in June 2025. I was advised by Prof. Kathryn Zurek during my time at Caltech. Prior to joining Caltech, I was an undergraduate at the Chinese University of Hong Kong.
